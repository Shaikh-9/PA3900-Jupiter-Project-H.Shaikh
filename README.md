# Supporting Code for the PA3900 Project (University of Leicester) by Hasan Shaikh

The following 2 iPython Notebook files (.ipynb) are supporting code created by Hasan Shaikh and Owen Morris solely for the report: "Apparent changes in the drift speed and aspect ratio of the Jovian GRS 
using SpeX data between 2018 â€“ 2020"  in University of Leicester's PA3900 Project: Jupiter's Atmosphere, supervised by Dr Leigh Fletcher. 

The code labelled: 'GRS_18.2.15_2.16 (1).ipynb' is the supporting code for the extraction of data from the cylindrical maps produced in IDL DRM using images taken from 
SpeX, IRTF on 15/02/18 in the 2.16 micron band, in data range 395-404.

The code labelled: 'Final Time Series Script.ipynb' is the supporting code for the time series produced, giving the results of the project, using data produced from 
44 scripts between 2018 - 2020, via images taken from SpeX, IRTF
